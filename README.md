Owambe is a fundraising website.

The site serves as a middle man between those who need help and those willing to assist.

For now all those who wish to assist will contact us and we'll arrange for them to meet the recepient
to confirm the authenticity of their requests. Hence the two main pages on the site are: contact us and help someone.

The images used on this website are stored in a bucket on Google Cloud console.
An nginx webserver was installed in a VM and a MySQL database was set up to receive messages from people.

The idea is that when people do contact us, their messages will have be stored in the MySQL database at GCP for us to read.
